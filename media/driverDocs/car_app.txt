	- Add rental works fine
	- Here you have only active drivers and Available for rent vehicles
	- As soon as you create a rental for a vehicle it will be automatically marked as On Rent and wont 
	  appear on the list for vehicles for rent
	- When a rental is done you can mark it as Inactive Rental and this will mark the vehicle as Available again
	- If you delete Rental instead of inactivating you have to mark the vehicle as active yourself.
	- You can add as many inactive rentals for a vehicle as you want, so you can add the old ones if you need to
	- But you can add only one active
	- The only need for drivers to be on a Rental is to be Active ones
	- Rent is weekly, so if you add 70, means 10 per day.
	- Rental 1-29 December (4 weeks), deposit 300, total rent 560, balance -260.
	- Links to see the Driver details and Vehicle details here, so the page doesn't get too much loaded.
	- Also the rental appears on each page.
	- On details page are too many options. You can edit it and add one more week, It will directly add -140 
	  on the balance.
	- Also transactions are here for this rental. Before we see the exports, lets add some transactions.
	- We can export the Agreement for now and the RentSheet actually. Export took so much time.
	- Agreement has everything from the rental details
	- RentSheet has every detail just like the example, shows all payment days and also Notes. Let's add one 
	  extra day - means 20 per day. It will add a last one of only 20 pounds
	- Accounts shows all the transactions for last 7 days, can change to last 30 days too. 
	- Add transaction by choosing the type of transaction. 
	- When add a car rent you will have all the cars which are on active rentals.Lets say he paid 60. On rental
	  info there are only 200 left now, the transaction is showed here. Now let's export this. Is shows 
	  everything.
	- Filter transactions or accounts. By vehicle. By driver. Reset. 
	- Don't delete the rentals bc it is here bc of the rental.
	- Now about the export, it is the same thing as the filter, but on excel, and it shows the balance too.
	- Lets add some data to check. Red for out, green for in. Also older than 7 days.
	- NOw let's export this.Select filters for all month. Explain that. Can also export by one table.
	- Now export changes if you select one of three: vehicle, driver or owner. It will be an export based on
	  those factors. Let's try:
	- Add another rental, add transaction to the other rental, but can export all the details for this vehicle
	  with all the retnals it has been on. 
	- Now export by that vehicle. choose today by clicking twice. Now it shows only Car rent table automatically
